# Feedback to other groups

We are group 2 (Bob Aaldering & Camiel Verdult) and give feedback to group 3, 10 and 17.

## Group 3 (Marnix Laar & Nian Luisman) - Software Defined Radio

Marnix netjes pak joh poah. Ik ken software defined radio nog niet, er was geen introductie maar meteen een hoe het werkt.

### Content of presentation

Veel informatie per slide. Er was een presentatie, dit was interessant en leerzaam.

### Use of slides

Erg gedetailleerd en compact (geen data dump). Goede illustraties.

### Presentation skills

Goed maar soms haperig, dat is ook wel begrijpelijk als er een abstract/complex onderwerp wordt gepresenteerd.

### Grade

Good

## Group 10 (Bogdan & Alfred) - Wireless Sensor Network

### Content of presentation

There is a good introduction and nice explanation of the technical aspects and use-cases of wireless sensor networks.

### Use of slides

Slides have good keywords and nice illustrations in the beginning, after Alfred started speaking, these keywords turned into full sentences or just a diagram.

### Presentation skills

Bogdan had good pronunciation and hand gestures. He looked into the crowd and knows what he wants to say, has a clear voice and explains things well. Sometimes he mispronounces a word but this is not disturbing. There was one instance where he did not remember the abbreviation but that was not a problem.

Alfred did not say anything and had his arms crossed for the entire duration of the first half of the presentation. When Alfred finally started spreaking, he was mostly reading his text from the slides.

### Grade

Good, we think that Bogdan and Alfred know the theory but may have a harder time to present. This was a good presentation and we understand that it may be difficult to present in front of a group.

## Group 14 (Thijmen & Alex) - How to speed up your wireless connection?

### Content of presentation

Compact and helpful slides, there was a deeper dive into radio theory and even physics. This was very interesting and useful to get a deeper understanding.

### Use of slides

Nice and clear pictures which help with visualising abstract information.

### Presentation skills

I am not sure who is who but the boy with the blond hair has a good clear voice and a pleasent tempo going while through the presentation. 

### Grade
Good, this was a nice presentation with a lot of useful information. The presentation skills made t
